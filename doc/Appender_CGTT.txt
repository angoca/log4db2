In order to install and configure the Global Temporary table appender you should
execute the scripts described here. If you want to change the configuration or
behavior, you are free to modify the source code of the appender.


# Prerequisites #

You need to have a user with the rights to create a tablespace.


# Code and configuration #

 * Install the appender from file:

    cd sql-pl
    db2 -tsf Appender_CGTT_Create.sql
    cd ..


# Test the appender #

Execute the appender directly, without log4db2, in order to test if the
appender is correctly configured. Sometimes there are file permissions problems,
or the path is wrong.

    db2 "CALL LOGGER.LOG_CGTT(0, 1, 'Message to log', NULL))"

Once you have finished this, you are ready to log!


# Uninstall

If you want to remove the configuration, and supposing you kept the same IDs,
just execute the following script:

    cd sql-pl
    db2 -tf Appender_CGTT_Drop.sql
    cd ..
