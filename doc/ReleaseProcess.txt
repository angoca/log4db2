There are three sections:

* BEFORE: To prepare the release.
* PERFORM: Tasks that conform the release.
* AFTER: Once the release has been done, some extra tasks to prepare the env.

BEFORE

* Run all tests to make sure there are not regressions.

  the next release
* Once finished, execute mvn release:perform.
  (If problems, mvn release:rollback)
* Fill the code release in GitHub (https://github.com/angoca/log4db2/releases)
* Create a directory in SourceForge with the version to release as name.
* Execute mvn.
* Publish the generated files in the target directory, into the just created
  directory in SourceForge (change the button text) and in GitHub.

  of README.txt

  compare the tag (git diff previous-tag current-tag)
